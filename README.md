# JavaScript Loose Comparison Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript related to loose comparison (==) and how it can lead to unexpected behavior when dealing with null and undefined values.

## The Problem

JavaScript's loose comparison (==) performs type coercion before comparison, which can lead to unexpected results.  The example showcases how this can affect the handling of null and undefined values.

## The Solution

The solution uses strict equality (===) to avoid type coercion and ensure a more accurate comparison. This provides robust handling of null and undefined, preventing unexpected behavior.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.js` and `bugSolution.js`.
3. Run `bug.js` and observe the output.
4. Run `bugSolution.js` and observe the corrected output.

## Lessons Learned

Always use strict equality (===) when comparing values in JavaScript, especially when dealing with null, undefined, or values that might be of different types.  This avoids unexpected behavior and improves the overall reliability of your code.
